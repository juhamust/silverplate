Silverplate is a modern code boilerplate for web development. It comes
with following features (preconfigured and read to use):

- **ES6** support with Babel
- **Gulp** with some commonly used plugins
- **Webpack** with both development and production optimized builds: Autoreload, minification
- **Angular 1.x** with component support (Angular 1.5) and commonly used modules
- **Bootstrap** 4.x with Sass
- **Generator** for components, services and views
- **Karma** for unit testing with both Chrome and PhantomJS

Silverplate is proudly derivated from [NG6-Starter](https://github.com/AngularClass/NG6-starter)
adding some opinionated modifications and additions on top of it.
